I was granted permission to use the project 1 template provided by the course.

to run: 
- make sure you are within the directory of my program file.
- enter python main.py within the terminal
- open a new terminal, navigate to the folder contents, run gradebot.exe project2

issues:
- if not achieving a perfect score of 65/65, rerun everything from scratch. 
- if still not achieving a perfect score, delete "totally_not_my_privateKeys.db" and run again.
